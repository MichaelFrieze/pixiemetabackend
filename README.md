# Running this locally with PostgreSQL

Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

Fill out the `.env` file with the correct values for your local development environment.

You will need:

```
APP_KEYS=
API_TOKEN_SALT=
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=
JWT_SECRET=
PGDATABASE=
PGHOST=
PGPASSWORD=
PGPORT=
PGUSER=
```

You might have to ask for these values.

Also, you can replace the postgres values with your own local database if you want.

Then, follow the rest of the documentation that Strapi provided below in this README.

# Or, you can run this locally with SQLite

- open the `config/database.js` file
- comment out the postgres connection
- uncomment the local sqlite connection
- save the file

> Make sure you don't push any code until you change back the `config/database.js` file.

Next, create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

Fill out the `.env` file with the correct values for your local development environment. You can remove the postgres values.

You will need:

```
APP_KEYS=
API_TOKEN_SALT=
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=
JWT_SECRET=
```

You might have to ask for these values.

Then, follow the rest of the documentation that Strapi provided below in this README.
